            WATERVILLE, Maine — Bob Thompson didn't want to be pinned down. He was a singular, secretive painter who
            kept a snare drum and a conga in his studio and was a friend of the great jazz saxophonist Ornette Coleman.
            He wanted to keep improvising, to keep riffing — on the Old Masters, on his dreams, on the mysterious
            operations of shape and color. He wanted to go deeper and deeper, further and further from words and their
            definitions.
        </p>
        <p>
            “I cannot find a place nor category in which to put my paintings nor a name to call them,” he said in an
            artist’s statement published in the Louisville Gazette in 1959. The next year, a perceptive reviewer
            detected “a grave, private urgency” in his work. And in 1965, Thompson said he was “trying to show what’s
            happening, what’s going on . . . in my own private way.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Thompson died in 1966. He had become addicted to heroin and overdosed shortly after a gallbladder operation.
            He was 28. Although his career was short (just eight years), Thompson was prolific, creating more than 1,000
            paintings. His work is now the subject of <a
                href="https://museum-exhibitions.colby.edu/exhibition/bob-thompson-this-house-is-mine/">“Bob Thompson:
                This House Is Mine,”</a> a captivating show at the <a href="https://www.colby.edu/museum/"> Colby
                College Museum of Art</a> in Waterville, Maine, through Jan. 9. The first Thompson retrospective in 20
            years, it will travel early next year to Chicago, before moving to Atlanta and Los Angeles.

        <p>
            Thompson, who was African American, was born and raised in Kentucky. His father died in a car crash when he
            was 13. Five years later, he enrolled as a pre-med student at Boston University. He dropped out, struggling
            with depression, and returned to the recently desegregated University of Louisville to study painting.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1958, Thompson moved to New York’s Lower East Side, befriending poets, musicians and fellow artists. He
            spent that summer — a formative one — in Provincetown, Mass., then an artist colony on Cape Cod. Abstraction
            was all the rage, but Thompson was eager to kick against orthodoxy. He encountered the work of <a
                href="http://www.artnet.com/artists/jan-muller/"> Jan Müller</a> (1922-1958), a figurative painter of
            charged narrative scenes who had died recently. Müller’s style — naive, narrative scenes with multiple
            figures and vivid colors — resonated deeply.

        </p>
        <p>
            In 1960, Thompson married Carol Plenda, a White woman. The couple traveled to Europe twice, first in 1961
            (when they settled for two years in Ibiza, Spain), and then in 1965, when they settled in Rome. That’s where
            the artist died.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m starting with this biographical outline — meandering around the edge of things — because that’s what
            Thompson did in his paintings. His figures are almost all silhouettes. They float, stand or sit about —
            occasionally sprouting wings, mouths, eyes or extravagant headwear — in lavishly colored landscapes that
            have the irrational, shapeshifting quality of dreams.
        </p>
        <p>
            He was such a sincere and sensuous searcher! I felt I knew about Thompson’s love of the Old Masters, but I
            was surprised by how deeply, directly and fruitfully his work was inspired by them. The Colby show includes
            loose but easily recognizable improvisations on paintings by Fra Angelico, Piero della Francesca, Titian,
            Tintoretto and Poussin, as well as an extended run of paintings riffing on “Los Caprichos,” a famous suite
            of etchings by Goya.

        <p>
            Goya’s dark visions — his sardonic, scathing, urgently exploratory tone — are behind so many of Thompson’s
            final works, with their black magic and bat wings and arcane allegory. But the works are also infused with
            the atmosphere of tenderness and religiosity in the Renaissance Italians and in Poussin. All of it is
            transposed into a modern manner that is knowingly gauche and at times clotted, but at the same time richly
            colored and full of feeling. Thompson’s misshapen figures rhyme and merge with the background in ways that
            are heavily inspired by Gauguin, as well as late Cézanne and early Matisse.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of what was Thompson dreaming? One would like to be able say — to spell out the actual content of his
            dreamwork. It is often disturbing — at once erotic and violent. But these are adult paintings, and Thompson
            was not interested in being explained away. Unfortunately, the organizers have smothered his mysterious,
            silently flowing paintings with far too much text. One painting is dwarfed and all but surrounded by a long
            quotation in an oversize font. Many others are hung on walls painted in brash, badly chosen colors. Much of
            the text is usefully informative, but it is flavored by the kind of academic identity politics from which
            Thompson would surely have recoiled.

        </p>
        <p>
            Reviewing a gallery show in 1962, a critic for Art News said Thompson brought “a private vision” or
            “fantasy” into “a quick instinctive transaction with form and color.” Quick and instinctive is right: The
            works have the feeling of syncopated drum rhythms, or reflex psychological impulses that toggle between what
            the poet and critic Randall Jarrell called “half the expression of a wish and half the defense against the
            wish.”

            Some feature monsters, lynchings and strange rituals; others show scenes of justice and retribution —
            although the anarchic atmosphere suggests sham justice. Lynchings, crucifixions and executions are a
            significant part of Thompson’s repertoire, as are looming black monsters. In such works as “The Hanging,”
            “The Judgment” and “The Execution,” it’s clear that he is wrestling — in a vein of deep disquiet — with the
            legacy of terror in the American South where he grew up, and where lynchings were linked to a pervasive idea
            — a kind of mass hysteria — of the sexual menace supposedly posed by Black boys and men.
        </p>
        <p>
            By the late 1950s and early ’60s, sexuality was for many oppressed people an expression of political
            liberation. Thompson was in love with Plenda, but such interracial relationships remained fraught, so you
            can imagine why images of black monsters and lynchings made it into his work. But even such intense and
            volatile subject matter is presented with Thompson’s characteristic ambivalence. He was an artist in love
            with his own opacity.

        </figure>
        <p>
            Jazz — with its complicated rhythms, surprising harmonies and gear-shifting melodies — was a huge influence
            on Thompson’s creative process. A major painting here, “Garden of Music,” owned by the Wadsworth Atheneum in
            Hartford, Conn., is squarely in the modernist Arcadian tradition of Cézanne’s “The Large Bathers,” Matisse’s
            “Music” and Gauguin’s “Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?” But instead of anonymous
            archetypes, Thompson’s painting presents identifiable jazz musicians he knew from Slugs Saloon and the Five
            Spot cafe in New York: Coleman, John Coltrane, Don Cherry, Sonny Rollins, Ed Blackwell and Charlie Haden. A
            nearby painting, “Homage to Nina Simone” (the legendary singer and civil rights activist was yet another
            friend), is a spectacular amalgam of Poussin and Matisse.
        </p>
        <p>
            The elusiveness, the refusal to settle, in Coltrane melodies has an equivalent in Thompson’s work. Every
            time you think his painting might return to a home key or settle into a clear reading, it shifts and floats
            off onto something more interesting.
